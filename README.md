# Project 2

User addition to the firebase database is buggy, however, Joel said that it would be okay for this purpose. Please do not refresh the page through the browser while you are logged in, otherwise, it will add the current person again to the database. 

We are very much content with what we learned in this class. Although we are slightly sad that we do not have all the original features in mind due to the timeframe. The skills I learned in class will definitely help us in our future projects when it comes to web development. Sam hopes to become a UX designer and the concept of components really help out. Vishank hopes to become a software engineer and these skills can help out in his journey (Javascript?).

Anyway, we had fun working on this project (though to be honest, there were frustrations BUT that's normal human emotions). We hope to expand this further with more functionalities and better design outside of this class and really, Sam learned a lot in this class and surely Vishank too!
